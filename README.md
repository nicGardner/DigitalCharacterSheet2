                                                   Digital Character Sheet 2: 

The Digital Character Sheet 2 is my second attempt at a web application using asp.net mvc designed as a tool to assist in the playing of pen-and-paper RPGs using the Cortex rule system.. The web app is a work in progress. Currently, it includes the ability to view all characters and their associated character sheets, and to add, delete, and update characters (though you can only modify their basic stats). 
In future builds, the web app will include the ability to fully edit all stats on a character sheet, a login system so players only have access to their own characters, and an dice rolling system that has a built in understanding of the game's rules. 

You can find the current build of the web app online here: https://digital-character-sheet.azurewebsites.net/

                                                        Getting Started

I coded this web app on Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 using the asp.net mvc template, created the database with Microsoft SQL Server Management Studeio 2017, and hosted it on Microsoft Azure.
I would recomend anyone using this code to download these tools.
